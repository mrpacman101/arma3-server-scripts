# arma3server-scripts
A collection of some Batch Files for easier maintenance of an Arma3 Server.
Simple to use and copy-pasteable templates.
This will help you with launching arma3server with lots of mods due to windows character limiations in shortcuts.
Also it will keep the arma3server.exe running without extened battleye installed. Credits for that goes to Seth^^ and for his inspiration. See more under Credits.
